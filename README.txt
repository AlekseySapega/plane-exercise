To increase my understanding of unity, I found a task on the unity forum.
Conditions of the complete task were next:
- You have a plane which must fly to the points that you created by touching on the sky;
- Plane must rotate to the next point;
- Parth mark must be spawned after the plane and their count must be limited;
- When the plane reached a point, the point must be destroyed;
- Flight of the plane must be animated.
